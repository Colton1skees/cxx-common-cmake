# Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 with the Clang dev tools installed.

 # Steps to build on windows:

1. Setup a visual studio solution using this command: 
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl.ex -T ClangCL -A x64 -B build 

2. Open solution(build\Dependencies.sln) in Visual Studio

3. On the top left, change the build type from `Debug` to `RelWithDbgInfo`

3. In the solution explorer, right click the 'remill' project. Go to 'Properties' -> 'General' -> and set these fields accordingly:
	- 'Platform Toolset' should be set to 'LLVM (clang-cl`
